Paying<br><br>accounts are entitled to 3 hours of remote webinar training via phone and internet upon sign up. Additional phone support and/or<br><br>trainings may incur additional charges. Refer to your pricing proposal. CRM will use commercially reasonable efforts to answer<br><br>questions regarding the Software during normal business hours. Should CRM need to access Licensee's data to provide support<br><br>services, CRM shall only access such account data once Licensee has given CRM authorization to do so, provided however,<br><br>Licensee authorizes CRM's account managers to access the administrative settings in Licensee's account solely for the purpose<br><br>of configuring Licensee's account settings and Licensee further grants CRM access to data for the limited purpose of executing<br><br>such directives as Licensee gives to CRM to fulfill its servicing obligations under the base agreement. CRM shall have no<br><br>obligation to support: (i) errors caused by Licensee’s website, negligence, hardware malfunction or other causes beyond CRM’s<br><br>reasonable control; or (ii) third party software or ASP services not licensed through CRM.<br><br>(b) Service Level Agreement.

So long as Licensee notifies CRM of such downtime within 10 days from the end of the applicable calendar month, and,<br><br>upon Licensee’s request, CRM will provide a service credit to Licensee against future fees due and owing hereunder. If availability for<br><br>Licensee’s account is below 98% but more than 96% in any calendar month, then, upon request, CRM will credit Licensee against<br><br>future fees an amount equal to 25% of the amount that would otherwise be due from Licensee for the affected service account for such<br><br>calendar month. If availability is at or below 96% in any calendar month, then CRM will, upon request, credit Licensee against future<br><br>fees an amount equal to the entire amount that would otherwise be due from Licensee for the affected calendar month. Aside from any<br><br>data breach obligations contained herein, the credits earned under this section will be the limit of CRM’s liability for amounts owed for<br><br>the nonavailability of the Software or any other failures of the Software. CRM shall have sole authority to make any final determination<br><br>regarding downtime in a given calendar month by measuring such downtime using tools it reasonably deems appropriate.

(c) Certain Limitations.<br><br>Except as explicitly set forth above, CRM does not offer any guarantee regarding the Software, and CRM shall not be liable<br><br>for any delays in responding to Licensee’s inquiries. Licensee hereby acknowledges that CRM may release or license new<br><br>versions or upgrades of the Software. Licensee’s license applies to any such upgrades and/or new versions to the extent such<br><br>upgrades and/or new versions are generally made available by CRM and do not constitute additional features and/or functionality<br><br>for which an additional fee is charged. Nothing herein shall obligate CRM to upgrade and/or improve the Software at any time.<br><br>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused their duly authorized representatives to execute this Agreement to be effective as of <strong>{{ termsOfServiceAgreedDate&nbsp;}}</strong></p>
